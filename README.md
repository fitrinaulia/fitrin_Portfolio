My name is Fitrin Aulia Salima. This repository is used for portfolio purpose in data science. It contains projects I have finished.

## [Project 1: EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis in COVID 19 Dataset (Python)](https://github.com/fitrinaulia/fitrinaulia.github.io/blob/main/EDA_Covid_19.ipynb)
EDA is applied to investigate the data and summarize the key insights. It is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. The data used in this project is COVID-19 Coronavirus Pandemic Dataset which is retrieved from https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/. 
In this project, I would like to perform basic EDA which contains:
1. Load data
2. Data cleaning
3. Plot and analysis

## [Project 2: Classification - Spaceship Titanic Transported Prediction](https://github.com/fitrinaulia/fitrinaulia.github.io/blob/main/Spaceship_Titanic_Kaggle.ipynb)
Spaceship-Titanic dataset is obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/c/spaceship-titanic. It has goal to predict which passengers were transported to an alternate dimention after the ship collided with a spacetime anomaly hidden within a dust cloud. Pretty much likely the Titanic ship whick sinked after hitting an iceberg, but this one is an outer-space version.

The dataset contains two files: train.csv is used to train the model and test.csv is the data test which we will predict.

In this project I do some data exploration and analysis, data pre-processing, and prediction using Random Forest Classifier.
