## [Project 1: EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis in Covid 19 Dataset (Python)](https://github.com/fitrinaulia/fitrinaulia.github.io/blob/main/EDA_Covid_19.ipynb)
EDA is applied to investigate the data and summarize the key insights. It is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. The data used in this project is COVID-19 Coronavirus Pandemic Dataset which is retrieved from https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/. 
In this project, I would like to perform basic EDA which contains:
1. Load data
2. Data cleaning
3. Plot and analysis
